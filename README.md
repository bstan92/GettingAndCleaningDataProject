# GettingAndCleaningDataProject

This project uses data involving Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones. The run_analysis.R script reads in that data, compiles it into a more usable format, and then tidies up a specific subset of that data set, including adding more descriptive names and summarizing by groups.

The CodeBook.md file explains the data used in this project with information from the source site. This file also includes additional details on the run_analysis.R script.
